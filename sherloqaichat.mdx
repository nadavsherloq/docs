## What is it?

Sherloq AI is your assistant inside the editor.\
You can ask it things like:

> **"How to filter out the exclude folder?"**\
> **"Why is this query using a LEFT JOIN?"**\
> **"Fix syntax error in this query"**

It reads the queries you’ve saved in Sherloq and gives answers that are **based on your real SQL**, not generic advice.

## How to use it

1. **Open Sherloq AI**\
   Click the Sherloq badge in your editor to open the chat.
2. **Ask a question**\
   Type your question in natural language — no need to write SQL.
3. **See the answer with real SQL examples**\
   Sherloq highlights the relevant logic and explains each part clearly.

## Example: Filtering Folders

🖼️ Here’s what it looks like when you ask a question like\
**“How to filter out the exclude folder?”**

### What this does:

- Joins the `query_folders` table on `parent_id`
- Excludes deleted folders (`deleted_at IS NULL`)
- Filters out names with terms like `monthly`, `weekly`, `template`, etc.

You’ll get both the **SQL** and the **explanation**—so you can learn or adjust it as needed.

## Tip: Ask About Anything

Try things like:

- _“What does this CASE WHEN mean?”_
- _“Can you rewrite this to use CTEs?”_
- _“How to join deals with customers?”_
- _“Fix this BigQuery syntax error”_

Sherloq AI is powered by the queries your team has already written, so it’s always relevant.
