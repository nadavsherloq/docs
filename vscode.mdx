## **Install our VSCode Plugin for VSCode IDEs** [**here**](https://docs.sherloqdata.io/datagripplugin)

## Don't find your IDE here?

We're actively working on adding more integrations, prioritizing them based on our users' requests.<br />**Let us know here what you're using**, and in the meantime, feel free to use our Chrome extension and set it as your default page.

### Directly from your IDE, you can:

1. Save queries / console

2. Share queries in one click

3. Inject snippets code using keyboard shorcut

And.. much more! Look out for the [Product Features](/features) to explore more Sherloq capabilities.
