title: 'Update Query'
---
To update an existing query, click on "Edit Query" (or enter the query profile)

<img src="/images/edit_query.png" 
   alt = "edit query"
   width="350" />

Now, make your changes, and then click "Save."

   alt = "edit query save changes"
   width="350" />

This will create a new version of the query.
<br></br> At the top of the code box, you'll see who created the version and when. This provides information about each version, allowing you to manage all versions, including adding collaborative notes, viewing and comparing differences between versions, and selecting the version you want to work with.
