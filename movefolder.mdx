title: "Move folder"
---

To move entire folders into other subfolders or reorganize your Sherloq, hover over the folder and click the 'Move' icon. Select the new location for the folder and click "OK."

<Tip>
  Note that permissions are inherited from the root folder in Sherloq, so moving a folder will update its permissions accordingly.
