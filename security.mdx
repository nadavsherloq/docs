## Development
Our development is NIST compliance. This helps Shrloq keep our data and information secure and safe, protecting critical infrastructure from both insider threats and attacks from the outside. 

## Environment & Encryption 
All data is stored on AWS and is under AWS encryption. We use AWS KMS to control the lifecycle of and permissions on the keys used to encrypt data on the customer’s behalf. All traffic is done within a VPC or between peered VPCs across regions and is transparently encrypted at the network layer when using supported Amazon EC2 instance types. At the application layer, we use the Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption protocol. All AWS service endpoints support TLS to create a secure HTTPS connection to make API requests. 

## Detection System

Sherloq Security Guidelines 
Sherloq's development environment is located on AWS servers in Ireland and as a result it applies to all KMS policies. In addition, Sherloq developers’ PCs have antivirus software installed that will provide protection against web application vulnerabilities. 
As AWS is Sherloq’s infrastructure environment, this includes alerting administrators of malicious activity and policy violations, as well as identifying and taking action against attacks.
