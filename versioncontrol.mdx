In the query profile, you can edit the query. Once you save the changes, the header will display **who updated the version and when.**

By clicking on the arrow next to the version name, a dropdown will open, showing all versions, allowing you to select and view previous changes to the query.

To **edit** a version name, click on the version name, and it will enter edit mode.

<Note> Versions are ordered by the time they were updated, in a queue order, with the newest version appearing at the top of the list. </Note>
