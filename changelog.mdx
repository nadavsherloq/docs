## October 2024 - What's new?


## 🔗 Sharing queries is now easier than ever
### Latest Update:July 28, 2024
🔗 Sharing queries is now easier than ever
You can now share your SQL directly from DataGrip in one click! (Or more specifically - in one keyboard shortcut)
All you need to do is:
Mark the query that you want to share and type CTRL+SHIFT+T.
Enter the user’s email you’d like to share it with,
And... that’s it 😊
We automatically create a shared folder with that query for you, and that person will immediately get an email + Slack letting them know that you’ve shared a query with them.
