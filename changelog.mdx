## July 2025 – What's New?

# ⚡ The new to intercat with your SQL ⚡

**🛠️ Modify Selected SQL with AI**

Sherloq now lets you edit any SQL directly from the console.
Just select the query, click “Modify with AI”, and Sherloq will open the chat with your code preloaded and ready to update.
The AI suggestions are based on your full SQL context from the repository, so the changes match exactly how you write your queries.

**🎓 AI Context Instructions and Guidance**

You can now add your own instructions to shape how Sherloq responds.
Include best practices, notes about specific tables or fields, or common ‘how-to’  and the AI will use that alongside your SQL context to stay aligned with your team's style.


**📥 Bulk Queries Importer**

Forget uploading queries one by one.
Now you can paste from anywhere, upload a file, or drop in raw SQL and Sherloq will automatically split and organize them into separate queries with generated titles and descriptions.
Perfect for getting started when your SQL is all over the place.

–––

Your feedback is gold. Let us know how it feels and what you’d love to see next ❤️

As more teams use the AI capability , we’re doubling down on making SQL workflows faster, easier, and more aligned with how you already work.

Looking forward 🚀

## June 2025 – What's New?

## November 2024 - What's new?

### ✨✨✨ Our NEW RE-DESIGN ✨✨✨

We’re super excited to give you all the details on what exactly has changed, and why.
Scroll below to learn more.

<img
  width="600"
  alt="Sherloq new design"
  src="/images/sherloq_new_design.gif"
/>

---

## First, why did we do this?

Our product needs to save you time, make your day-to-day feel much easier, and basically help you become the best, most productive, version of your data-self.

What is shouldn’t be doing is to be VERY slow, painfully rigid, and feel buggy.

But it definitely was doing that.

This was literally the #1 (yes, #1) feedback we got from our customers and users. And if you’re telling us about it over and over again, it makes it THE most important thing we could be doing right now.

So we decided to put an end to this chaos, and do one simple product amazingly well - meaning easy, simple and beautiful. In our wildest dreams, you should have fun using it.

So, we hope you’ll love this new version (at least as much as we do…) and find your happy place while using it 😇

**PS - thanks for all the users out there that hopped on calls with us to brainstorm, validate and share their thoughts with us. It means the world to us.**

<img
  width="500"
  alt="Sherloq new design"
  src="/images/sherloq_before_after_main.png"
/>

---

## The Change(s)

- **UI: Well…. basically everything :)**
- **Perfomance, performance, performance** - this was the most important thing for us. Your experience should feel flawless.
  So no more waiting for a query to be created, no more loading between different pages of the product, no more waiting dozens of seconds to simply delete a folder.
- **Queries are much clearer -**
  - We understood what’s important to show in preview mode and what isn’t (which we then added to the query profile).
  - The query profile has no-load and easily appears as it pops-up from the bottom of your screen.

<img
  width="500"
  alt="Sherloq new design"
  src="/images/sherloq_before_after_profile.png"
/>

- **Folders are finally much more organized** -
  - We switched the folder view to be more like any storage app (Google Drive, Notion etc). That means no more one long page of queries in subfolders in folders. Rather we give each folder the respect it deserves with a page of it’s own.
  - You can easily see which users each folder is shared with.
- **The search experience is easy-to-use** -
  - Filters are now out in the open - did you know that that you had the ability to filter your search results based on the query date, person, source and more? Probably not, because it was hidden in some kind of (honestly weird) icon.
    Filters are now visible to all, and even better - you can understand your search results based on the options in each filter. Try it out and let us know what you think :)

<img
  width="500"
  alt="Sherloq new design"
  src="/images/sherloq_before_after_search.png"
/>

- **Removing the clutter** (we’re a plugin.. so anything on the screen needs to be chosen carefully) -
  - No more annoying left side panel - it’s now in a simple side menu
  - The history tab also moved to the side menu
  - Public section became a folder
  - And Vuola - you get much more room to emphasize and see the important stuff (like, let’s say, the folders and queries themselves).
- **Creating a new SQL became a whole lot easier** with the very straightforward new ‘\+’ button (when you think about it, how wasn’t this an option until now?…)
- And more like: automatically **generating a title (which is new) and a description** (which isn’t) is now totally up to your choice, editing a query is in the query profile, bug fixes…

So many changes (and we’re sure that you’ll notice some more while using it), all in the hopes of making this product as simple and easy to use as possible.

## What Didn’t Change

- Our commitment to our users and customers
- Our mission of creating once place for everything SQL
- Our obsession to make every minute count
- Our office pet

This is still V1 - so we’d absolutely LOVE to hear any thoughts, concerns or feedback you have.

And here’s a sneak peak to what’s up next:

- Keyboard shortcuts
- Onboarding
- Snippets are everywhere
- Auto-editing from your IDE
- Git Integration
- Permissions
- ERD in product

So.. stay tuned\! 😜
