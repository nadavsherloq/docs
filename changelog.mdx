## December 2024 - What's new?

<Icon icon="code" /> **All Queries as Snippets**
After the high adoption for this feature, now every query is available as a snippet and no need to carefully select them anymore! They’re all accessible directly from the top of your editor.
Just type `@@` in your editor, and you’ll see all queries pop up.
PLUS: Start typing keywords, and the query names will filter automatically for faster access.
The snippets are here to save you a ton of hassle and make dealing with repetitive queries a breeze.

<Icon icon="ballot" /> **Formatting Directly in Your SQL Editor**
We’ve enhanced SQL formatting to make it fully customizable to your preferences. 
Head to the setting menu to set your preferred SQL dialect, and Sherloq will format queries based on that choice.
**Want to format on the fly?** Just highlight your SQL, right-click, or use `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + 0` to format it instantly in your editor.

<video autoPlay muted loop playsInline className="w-full aspect-video" src="/images/formatting_new.mp4" />

<Icon icon="diagram-lean-canvas" /> **ERD Generator (Entity Relationship Diagram)**
We’re excited to introduce visual query insights!
For every saved query, you can now view a diagram that shows the connections between tables.
This gives you a clear picture of the query flow and table relationships at a glance.

## November 2024 - What's new?

### ✨✨✨ Our NEW RE-DESIGN ✨✨✨

We’re super excited to give you all the details on what exactly has changed, and why.
Scroll below to learn more.

<img width="600" alt="Sherloq new design" src="/images/sherloq_new_design.gif" />

***

## First, why did we do this?

Our product needs to save you time, make your day-to-day feel much easier, and basically help you become the best, most productive, version of your data-self.

What is shouldn’t be doing is to be VERY slow, painfully rigid, and feel buggy.

But it definitely was doing that.

This was literally the #1 (yes, #1) feedback we got from our customers and users. And if you’re telling us about it over and over again, it makes it THE most important thing we could be doing right now.

So we decided to put an end to this chaos, and do one simple product amazingly well - meaning easy, simple and beautiful. In our wildest dreams, you should have fun using it.

So, we hope you’ll love this new version (at least as much as we do…) and find your happy place while using it 😇

**PS - thanks for all the users out there that hopped on calls with us to brainstorm, validate and share their thoughts with us. It means the world to us.**

<img width="500" alt="Sherloq new design" src="/images/sherloq_before_after_main.png" />

***

## The Change(s)

* **UI: Well…. basically everything :)**

* **Perfomance, performance, performance** - this was the most important thing for us. Your experience should feel flawless.
  So no more waiting for a query to be created, no more loading between different pages of the product, no more waiting dozens of seconds to simply delete a folder.

* **Queries are much clearer -**

  * We understood what’s important to show in preview mode and what isn’t (which we then added to the query profile).

  * The query profile has no-load and easily appears as it pops-up from the bottom of your screen.

<img width="500" alt="Sherloq new design" src="/images/sherloq_before_after_profile.png" />

* **Folders are finally much more organized** -

  * We switched the folder view to be more like any storage app (Google Drive, Notion etc). That means no more one long page of queries in subfolders in folders. Rather we give each folder the respect it deserves with a page of it’s own.

  * You can easily see which users each folder is shared with.

* **The search experience is easy-to-use** -

  * Filters are now out in the open - did you know that that you had the ability to filter your search results based on the query date, person, source and more? Probably not, because it was hidden in some kind of (honestly weird) icon.
    Filters are now visible to all, and even better - you can understand your search results based on the options in each filter. Try it out and let us know what you think :)

<img width="500" alt="Sherloq new design" src="/images/sherloq_before_after_search.png" />

* **Removing the clutter** (we’re a plugin.. so anything on the screen needs to be chosen carefully) -

  * No more annoying left side panel - it’s now in a simple side menu

  * The history tab also moved to the side menu

  * Public section became a folder

  * And Vuola - you get much more room to emphasize and see the important stuff (like, let’s say, the folders and queries themselves).

* **Creating a new SQL became a whole lot easier** with the very straightforward new ‘+’ button (when you think about it, how wasn’t this an option until now?…)

* And more like: automatically **generating a title (which is new) and a description** (which isn’t) is now totally up to your choice, editing a query is in the query profile, bug fixes…

So many changes (and we’re sure that you’ll notice some more while using it), all in the hopes of making this product as simple and easy to use as possible.

***

## What Didn’t Change

* Our commitment to our users and customers

* Our mission of creating once place for everything SQL

* Our obsession to make every minute count

* Our office pet

***

This is still V1 - so we’d absolutely LOVE to hear any thoughts, concerns or feedback you have.

And here’s a sneak peak to what’s up next:

* Keyboard shortcuts

* Onboarding

* Snippets are everywhere

* Auto-editing from your IDE

* Git Integration

* Permissions

* ERD in product

So.. stay tuned! 😜

Enter the user’s email you’d like to share it with,
And... that’s it 😊
We automatically create a shared folder with that query for you, and that person will immediately get an email + Slack letting them know that you’ve shared a query with them.
