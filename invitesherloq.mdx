In the settings view, click on the “Invite” button, and enter your teammates’ emails, separated by commas (e.g., nadav@sherloqdata.io, noy@sherloqdata.io).


This will send an automatic email to your teammates, inviting them to join Sherloq. Once they accept the invite, they will join your Sherloq workspace. You can then share the folder with them to collaborate.

<Note> You can invite and collaborate in a shared workspace only with teammates who have the same email domain.</Note>

**Tip 1:** Teams using Sherloq can save up to 2 hours per week on data asset discovery!

**Tip 2:** Import your team’s shared queries into a shared folder by following the import queries guide [here].
