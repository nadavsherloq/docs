This will send an automatic email to your teammates, inviting them to join Sherloq. <br />
Once they accept the invite, they will join your Sherloq workspace. You can then share the folder with them to collaborate.

<Note> You can invite and collaborate in a shared workspace only with teammates who have the same email domain.</Note>
