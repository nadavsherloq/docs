title: 'Display views'

We know everyone has their own preference for viewing queries, so weâ€™ve created two different display options. <br></br>
Just choose the one you prefer! ðŸ˜Š

   width="500" />

   ## Thumbnails view
   In the thumbnails view, you can see a query preview with the following details:
   - Query name
- Creator of the query
- Date the query was created or last updated
- Activities â€“ who interacted with the query and how many interactions were made. For more information, read about it here.
- Tags (if any)
- A short overview of the query description, expandable with the toggle icon
- Code preview of the query
