## Team Management for Admins

* Admins can now **create, edit, or remove teams** effortlessly.

* Assign users to teams based on their roles or projects.

* Manage folder-level-permissions with precision to align with your organization's structure.

* Control who can view query histories based on each team. Users will only see query histories shared by their assigned teams, ensuring data visibility stays within organization’s preferences.

### Go to the Settings menu and then navigate to the Admin tab.

In the Admin section, you can manage all Sherloq workspaces, add admins, or assign/remove other admins.

### ![](/images/admin_portal.png) Team Management section

You can manage teams by assigning names and adding members using their email addresses or Sherloq accounts. Each user can belong to multiple teams as needed.

<Note>
  &#x20;For users who haven’t signed up for Sherloq yet, you can assign them to a team, and once they log in to the platform, they will automatically receive the assigned permissions.
</Note>

### ![](/images/manage_teams.png)Query History section

You can manage which teams have access to query histories. By default, query history is set to "Everyone," meaning all Sherloq users can see each other’s query histories.

<Tip>
  If you want to set specific permissions — for example, making it so that only Team #1 members can view each other’s query histories (and the same for Team #2), you’ll need to create and assign teams accordingly.
