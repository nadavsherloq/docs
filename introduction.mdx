Using our SQL repo plug-in, you can collaboratively manage, save, and share your SQL code, without leaving your IDE. Stop the “where the f*ck did I put that SQL” moments and focus on data analysis.

## "Sure, I know exactly where that query is. I'll send it to you straight away."
*Said no one, never.*



Sherloq is all about helping SQL users focus on what really matters - analyzing data and creating insights. Here’s what doesn’t matter, but for years we’ve been spending too much time on:
- Trying to remember when was the last time I ran a SQL on some ‘users_v2_old’ legacy table, and who might know where I put it
- Asking the company-wide ‘data-champs’ Slack channel if someone can send me the most updated CASE WHEN condition we talked about in last week’s guild meeting.
- Going over 252 queries in my team’s ‘All Queries’ Docs file with cmd+f: ‘prospect_id’.

A few dozens of ping-pongs on Slack and 4 cups of coffee later, you give up and write something you sort of remember doing.
And the result? Getting inconsistent SQL, and inconsistent data.

As we ourselves were (and are still) heavy SQL users, we were looking to create a solution that gives us just the right amount of order we need. Something that’s actually built for this type of code.

That means that it’s organized and managed, but not too stiff.
It’s sits on top of our IDE, but doesn’t actually require any integration or access to the data.

It’s collaborative, but also has a place for our own personal work.
It can be used by people that love data and understand it, and by those that don’t.
