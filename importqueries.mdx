**We understand how frustrating it can be to do the heavy lifting and create your initial repo.**

That’s why we've made it easy to import your queries from existing saved queries, scattered text, or even your current console. <br></br>
Simply send us your existing work, and Sherloq will upload it seamlessly.

<Tip> Data users who upload at least 15 of their queries have an 80% higher retention rate. </Tip>

<Tip> You can also use our AI SQL Organizer tool for this task. </Tip>

## Upload queries from file/s
To upload, go to the settings, select “Import from File,” and upload a CSV, TXT, or DOC file—format doesn't matter, our engine will automatically parse it. In less than 30 minutes, you’ll see your queries in Sherloq and receive an email notification.

Additionally, we’ve gathered some tips on how to easily import your saved SQL queries based on your current platform:
