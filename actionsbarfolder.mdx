By hovering over a folder, an action bar will appear with the following options:

- ** Copy folder link**
- **Share folder**
- **Edit folder**
- **Remove folder**

<img src="/images/actions_bar_folder_hover.png" 
   alt = "actions bar folder hover"
   width="400" />

   <Note>Copying the link will only allow users with the necessary permissions to access the folder. You can read more about this in the permissions section.</Note>

   Additionally, you can access these actions by clicking on the folder and then selecting the three dots to open the menu.
