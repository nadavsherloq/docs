Great! You just installed Sherloq on top of your IDE (in case you didn't download yet, please install here)

Here are your first next steps in order to help you get started and create your repo!

## Go through this checklist and get started:

<Steps>

<Step title = "📌 Pin the plugin to your screen."> 
Pin your plugin to your IDE for faster access.
You can do it by tutroial [here]("/snippets").
</Step>


<Step title ="🗂️ Import your exsiting saved SQL queries">
Don't worry, we made it easy for you 😉
You can do it here.
</Step>


<Step title = "🤝🏻 Invite team members to join your Sherloq workspace">
Start creating the collaborative workspace in Sherloq. Invite them via the settings window. Once they log in, create and share the team folder with them.
</Step>


<Step title = "📄 Create your first query ">  
You can do it by Sherloq or directly from your IDE. Use the AI feature to reduce your time. See more [here].

</Step>

<Step title = "🏃 Use a query it in your IDE"> 
Add a query as a snippet and use it by typing `@@` in your editor. See more about it [here]. Start saving your time!

</Step>

</Steps>

And… that’s it! 🎉
You can now start using Sherloq as your single source of truth for all your SQL queries.
No more waiting around for that SQL query again!
