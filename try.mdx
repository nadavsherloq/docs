🔗 Sharing queries is now easier than ever
You can now share your SQL directly from DataGrip in one click! (Or more specifically - in one keyboard shortcut)
All you need to do is:
Mark the query that you want to share and type CTRL+SHIFT+T.
Enter the user’s email you’d like to share it with,
And... that’s it 😊
We automatically create a shared folder with that query for you, and that person will immediately get an email + Slack letting them know that you’ve shared a query with them.

## 📁 Team Management & Shared Folders
### Latest Update:June 15, 2024
The new feature allows you to create a team from existing members, manage it, and share folders with them, not just individually.
It’s now easier to share across your relevant team and manage it efficiently.
To share with your own team, go to shared folders, select the members you want to create a team with, and click on “Create as Team”. After naming it, you can see it in the “Add from Team” section.
