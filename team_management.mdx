This feature allows you to create a team from existing members, manage it, and share folders with the team as a group, not just individually.

It’s now easier to share with your relevant team and manage permissions efficiently.

To share with your team, go to the shared folders, select the members you want to create a team with, and click on “Create as Team.” After naming the team, you’ll be able to see it in the “Add from Team” section.

As an admin, you can manage teams within the organization. Once a user is added to a team, they will automatically be granted the relevant permissions needed for that specific team.
