### **Share a saved query from the plugin**

Hover over the query and click the share icon.
At the top of the share modal, you'll see the members who already have access via shared folders.

Any members or teams you add manually will appear in the "Queries" section below.

<Note> Query-level permissions override folder-level permissions if there's a conflict.</Note>

<img src="/images/sharequery.png" 
   alt = "share query"
   width="500" />

   <img src="/images/sharequerymodal.png" 
   alt = "share query modal"
   width="500" />

To share a query by link, click on the link icon ðŸ”— and the query will be saved to your clipboard.

You can then send the link directly to your teammates.

<Note>
  Only Sherloq users with the relevant folder permissions will be able to access the query.

  Learn how to [share the folder here](https://docs.sherloqdata.io/newquery).
</Note>

### **Share a query directly from your SQL editor**

You can easily share a query directly from your SQL editor, even if it isn't a saved query.

Mark the query on you editor, than type: `CMD/Ctrl` `Shift` `T` or right click "Share a Query".

Give the query a name and choose the email of the user you'd like to share it with. Click "Share".

Sherloq will automatically create a shared folder with that user, and send the user an email notifying them that you've shared a query with them.
