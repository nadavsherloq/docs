### **Share a saved query from the plugin**

To share a query, click on the link icon and the query will be saved to your clipboard.

You can then send the link directly to your teammates.

<Note />

### **Share a query directly from your SQL editor**

You can easily share a query directly from your SQL editor, even if it isn't a saved query.

Mark the query on you editor, than type: CMD/Ctrl+Shift+T or right click "Share a Query".

Give the query a name and choose the email of the user you'd like to share it with. Click "Share".

Sherloq will automatically create a shared folder with that user, and send the user an email notifying them that you've shared a query with them.
