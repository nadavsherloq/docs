Snippets are designed to save you time with repetitive and recurring queries that can be easily **injected directly into your IDE.**

Simply go to your editor and type `@@`. All your query snippets will appear in a list, and you can navigate through the list using the keyboard. <br></br>
Select the relevant query by pressing `Enter` to inject it into your screen.

   To add a new snippet, go to Sherloq and click the **@@ icon** in the query menu or through the query profile. Once saved, the icon will indicate that the query is now a snippet, and youâ€™ll be able to access it by typing `@@` in your IDE.
