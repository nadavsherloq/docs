title: 'Create New Query'
---

<Tip> You can also save queries directly from your IDE using the keyboard shorcut `shift` + `âŒ˜ / ctrl` + `D` .</Tip>

To create a **new query** in Sherloq, click the `+` button and select `Query`.

<img src="/images/new_folder_and_query.png" 
   alt = "new folder and query"
   width="400" />


In the new modal, fill out the query, name, description, and location (each query must be located in a folder or subfolder.).

**Using AI**, once you enter the query in the text box, you will have the option to generate an auto-title and auto-description to your queries in order to save your time.

These keywords will be helpful for refining your search in future use.

<img src="/images/new_query.png" 
   alt = "new query"
   width="400" />

After completing the form, click "Save".

Yay, you just created a query! ðŸŽ‰
