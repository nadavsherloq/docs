<Tip> You can also save queries directly from your IDE using the keyboard shortcut </Tip>

To save a **new query** in Sherloq, click the `+` button and select `Query`.

<img width="400" alt="new folder and query" src="/images/new_folder_and_query.png" />

In the new modal, fill out the query, name, description, and location (each query must be located in a folder or subfolder.).

**Using AI**, once you enter the query in the text box, you will have the option to generate an auto-title and auto-description to your queries in order to save your time.

These keywords will be helpful for refining your search in future use.

After completing the form, click "Save".

Yay, you just saved a query! ðŸŽ‰
