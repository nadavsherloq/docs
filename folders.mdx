The Sherloq repository is organized into folders, where each folder can contain subfolders and queries. <br></br>
**Common use cases for folders include:**

- Projects
- Product Features
- Onboarding
- SQL Syntax
- Teams
- Best Practices and Common Queries

## Type of folders
There are  3 types of folders:

1. **Personal**: All subfolders and queries will be visible only to you.
2. **Shared with members or teams**: Share the folder by adding specific members or teams.
3. **Public:** Anyone in your company (with the same email domain) can see this folder, including its subfolders and queries.

<Note> Folder permissions apply to all subfolders. Setting permissions for the root folder will affect all its subfolders.</Note>

<Note> For more information about team management, see more here</Note>

## Folders Type Filter

   On the ‘My Sherloq’ (main) screen, you can filter and hide specific folder types using the filter icon.

    <img src="/images/filter_main_screen_folders.png" 
   alt = "filter main screen folders"
   width="400" />


## Breadcrumb and Navigation
When you enter a folder, the header row will display a breadcrumb trail, providing quick insight into your current location in the navigation process. You can click on any folder in the chain to navigate directly to that folder.

You can also use the back and next buttons to revisit the recent pages you accessed in Sherloq.

   ## Actions Bar
   By hovering over a folder, an action bar will appear with the following options:

- Copy link
- Share
- Edit folder
- Remove folder

<img src="/images/actions_bar_folder_hover.png" 
   alt = "actions bar folder hover"
   width="400" />

   <Note>Copying the link will only allow users with the necessary permissions to access the folder. You can read more about this in the permissions section.</Note>

   Additionally, you can access these actions by clicking on the folder and then selecting the three dots to open the menu.

   <img src="/images/actions_bar_folder_dots.png" 
   alt = "actions bar folder dots"
   width="400" />
