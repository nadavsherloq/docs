## Folders Types
There are  3 types of folders:

1. **Personal**: All subfolders and queries will be visible only to you.
2. **Shared with members or teams**: Share the folder by adding specific members or teams.
3. **Public:** Anyone in your company (with the same email domain) can see this folder, including its subfolders and queries.

<Note> Folder permissions apply to all subfolders. Setting permissions for the root folder will affect all its subfolders.</Note>
